The project covered the functional implementations such as :
○	Transform the provided CSV file into a structured format suitable for analysis and storage.
○	Store the processed data efficiently in a chosen data store for easy retrieval and management.
○	Make sure the code is split in a modular fashion.

For the initial phase I have used the commandLinneRunner interface to load the csv and parse it and store it into an temporary data base(H2- DB).
